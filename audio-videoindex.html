    <h2>Cats are self-sufficient creatures, but it doesn't imply they don't feel or have feelings. Like all other
        animals, they can form bonds with their human companions and read their emotional states. Although, it may not
        come as naturally to them as it does to dogs.</h2>
    <h2>As predators, cats exhibit a strong feeling of independence because they frequently have to fend for themselves
        and their offspring, prompting the question, "Do cats feel emotions?" Cats are not emotionless animals, and
        their independent attitude and dominant personality may make it trickier to grasp that they may sense emotions.
        Although they rarely display emotions or their feelings are difficult to understand, paying attention to their
        body language will give you an idea of how they are feeling right now. </h2>
